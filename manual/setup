Dear COP 4620 Student:

    Welcome to fifteen weeks of torture !!  We will try to make
    sure this course is comparable to taking a drink of water
    from a firehose.  So, brace yourselves for lots of material.

Here are some instructions on getting started with the tws system:

1.  Go to your home directory.
2.  Execute:

	  %mkdir tiny
	  %cd tiny

3.  %cp -r ~manuel/systems/tws/tiny.src/* .      <--- Don't forget the dot!

4.  Edit the first line in Makefile: MYOBJS should describe
    the path to your tiny directory.  Likewise, edit the third line
    in file "tc" and change MYOBJS.

5.  To compile the Tiny compiler (while in your tiny directory):

	 %make

This will cause various commands to be performed:

       {compilation of your Constrainer.c}
       {compilation of your CodeGenerator.c}
       {compilation of lex.tiny into lex.yy.c}
       {compilation of lex.yy.c into lex.yy.o}
       {compilation parse.tiny into code.y}
       {compilation of code.y into y.tab.c}
       {comnpilation of y.tab.c into y.tab.o}
       {loading of y.tab.o and lex.yy.o into parse}

To test the Tiny Compiler/Interpreter:

	 %tc tests/p1   +   Seven test programs.  It is strongly
	 %tc tests/p2   |   suggested you take a look at these test
	 %tc tests/p3   |   programs.  Your first assignment (see 8,
	 %tc tests/p4   |   below) consists of writing an eighth Tiny
	 %tc tests/p5   |   program, to become familiar with the
	 %tc tests/p6   |   language and the compiler.
	 %tc tests/p7   +   

To test the interpreter alone:

	 %cd tests
	 %~manuel/systems/tws/bin/interpret

GOOD LUCK !!
